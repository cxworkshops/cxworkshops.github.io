# Welcome to CxWorkshops

Welcome to CxWorkshops, Checkmarx's interactive labs for learning about and getting hands-on with Checkmarx products and solutions. Whether you're an existing Checkmarx customer or evaluating Checkmarx for your application security needs, we have a lab for it!

These interactive labs are intended to be instructor or proctor-led, however the content is freely available, should you wish to try the labs in your own environment or in your own time.  

{: .note }
When attending a virtual or in-person workshop, the proctor will provide an temporary API key to provision access to a Checkmarx One tenant.  If you wish to try these labs on your own, you will need your own tenant and/or API key.  To create an API key, see [Generating an API Key](https://checkmarx.com/resource/documents/en/34965-118315-authentication-for-checkmarx-one-cli.html#UUID-a4e31a96-1f36-6293-e95a-97b4b9189060_UUID-1e7abdfa-77eb-2a6c-f12a-c812a1e1dcf7)
